Restaurant.csv - The dataset containing restaurant-related information.

Level 1 Tasks.ipynb - Contains initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) and basic data processing.

Level 2 Tasks.ipynb - Includes advanced analytics and deeper insights into the data.

**Project Objectives**

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, duplicate entries, and incorrect data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying patterns and trends in the restaurant dataset.

Visualizations: Creating charts and graphs to present insights effectively.

Advanced Analysis: Implementing techniques such as predictive modeling or clustering (if applicable).

**Tools and Technologies Used**

Python: Programming language for data processing and analysis.

Pandas: Library for data manipulation.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: Libraries for data visualization.

Jupyter Notebook: Environment for interactive computing.
